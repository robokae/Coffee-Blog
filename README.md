# Coffee-Website

A simple, responsive, and functional website built using HTML, CSS, and the amazing Bootstrap Framework. For my first website, I decided to go with the coffee theme because coffee is something that I am very passionate about and what better way to express that than to build a website about it. 

Initially, the website will be static, but over time, I would like to make it more dynamic with the addition of JavaScript and its frameworks.
