# Coffee-Website

A simple, responsive, and functional website built using HTML, CSS, and the amazing Bootstrap Framework. For my first website, I decided to go with the coffee theme because coffee is something that I am very passionate about and what better way to express that than to build a website about it. 

Initially, the website will be static, but over time, I would like to make it more dynamic with the addition of JavaScript and its frameworks.

* Created the basic markup and styling of the website. 
* Finished most of the navigation bar styling. It's also pretty responsive (thanks to Bootstrap) and looks and works wonderfully in smaller screens.  
* Still need to work on the main content of the landing page, including adding images and positioning elements.

* Fixed the issue in which there was padding present in the collapsable menu in x-small to medium screen sizes. 
* Background image now properly displaying within remaining view height beneath the navigation bar. 
* Tweaked the positioning of the welcome messgage. It is now centered.
