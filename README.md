# Coffee Blog
A minimal website where I can blog about coffee, a topic that I am very passionate about. The blog is developed using the amazing Gatsby JavaScript framework for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend.

## April 22, 2023
- After three years, I am excited to revisit my coffee website project and resume work on developing the blog!!!
- There are a lot of exciting plans for the new and improved coffee website, such as:
    - A new tech stack: I will be using Gatsby for the first time for the user interface, as well as Spring Boot for the backend.
    - A complete redesign of the website, which will have the following pages:
        - A home page that will feature the most recent blog posts
        - An about page 
        - And more to come as I continue working on this project

- Created the basic markup and styling of the website. 
- Finished most of the navigation bar styling. It's also pretty responsive (thanks to Bootstrap) and looks and works wonderfully in smaller screens.  
- Still need to work on the main content of the landing page, including adding images and positioning elements.

## January 26, 2020
- Fixed the issue in which there was padding present in the collapsable menu in x-small to medium screen sizes. 
- Background image now properly displaying within remaining view height beneath the navigation bar. 
- Tweaked the positioning of the welcome messgage. It is now centered.
